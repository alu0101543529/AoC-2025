## 📖 About

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) programming challenges, implemented in JavaScript. Advent of Code is an annual event featuring daily programming puzzles throughout December, designed to help developers improve their problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.

## 🎯 What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language. Each day from December 1st to December 25th (unfortunately this year it ends on the 12th), a new two-part puzzle is released at midnight EST. The challenges range from simple algorithmic problems to complex computational tasks, making it perfect for:

- 🧠 Sharpening problem-solving skills
- 💻 Learning new programming concepts
- 🎓 Practicing algorithms and data structures
- 🎉 Having fun with code during the holiday season

## 📁 Repository Structure

```
AoC-2025/
├── Day 1: Secret Entrance/
│   └── day1_secret_entrance.js
├── Day 2: Gift Shop/
│   └── day2_gift_shop.js
├── Day 3: Lobby/
│   └── day3_lobby.js
├── ...
├── package.json
├── LICENSE
└── README.md
```

Each day's challenge is contained in its own folder with:
- **JavaScript solution file** (`dayX_*.js`) - The implementation solving both parts of the puzzle

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alu0101543529/AoC-2025.git
cd AoC-2025
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Running Solutions

To run a specific day's solution:

```bash
node "Day 1: Secret Entrance/day1_secret_entrance.js"
node "Day 2: Gift Shop/day2_gift_shop.js"
node "Day 3: Lobby/day3_lobby.js"
```

Or navigate to the specific day folder and run:

```bash
cd "Day 1: Secret Entrance"
node day1_secret_entrance.js
```

## 💡 Key Concepts & Techniques

Throughout these challenges, various programming concepts and techniques are explored:

- Array manipulation and transformations
- String parsing and pattern matching
- Algorithm optimization
- Data structure implementation
- Mathematical problem-solving
- Regular expressions
- Recursive solutions
- Dynamic programming

## 📝 Notes

- Each solution is self-contained and can be run independently
- Solutions prioritize clarity and readability while maintaining efficiency
- Both parts of each day's puzzle are solved in the same file

## 🤝 Contributing

While this repository primarily documents my personal journey through Advent of Code 2025, suggestions and discussions are welcome! Feel free to:

- Open an issue if you spot a bug or have a question
